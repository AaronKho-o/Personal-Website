            <p class="description">Pleasure to make your virtual acquaintance! I started this website to share interesting concepts in statistics, computing and mathematics. It was during my undergraduate studies when I realised being skillful in any one of the three subjects required mastery of the other two. The interdependence of each fascinates me, and it was that fascination paired with a hunger to show off their charms that led to the start of this project.</p>
            <p class="description">Outside of time spent working as a DevOps engineer and studies, I enjoy cooking, hiking in the lake district and watching Netflix. Read my blogs to discover more about life in the UK from an Asian's perspective. Feel free to reach out for a cup of tea anytime!

        <div class = "title">Why we divide sample variance by n-1</div>
        <p class = "blogText">It is well know that the formula to calculate variance of a sample dataset is the sum of squares divided by the sample size less one. I remember being asked by a friend: "Why minus one?" To my great shame as a statistics major, I could give neither a rigorous nor intuitive answer. This post serves to regain some lost pride and is aimed at those who have a basic understanding of what mean and variance represent.</p>
        <p class = "blogText">We shall take an empirical approach, which is a fancy way of saying we work with observations rather than pure theory. Suppose we have a random generator of numbers from 1 to 10. We use it to generate 10 numbers and obtain the set (7 8 1 5 6 9 10 1 2 1).</p>
        <p class = "blogText">Our goal is to describe this dataset with a single number. Let us take the average to obtain the sample mean = 5. The sample mean is called a statistic, and the sample variance is an example of another.</p>
        <p class = "blogText">Variance is a measure of how disperse the data is. Thus, it makes sense that it consists of the sum of squared deviations from the sample mean, 5 in this case. The next logical step would be to average it out by dividing by 10. However, think about this for a moment. We are actually introducing bias to our statistic! </p>
        <p class = "blogText">If our data was represented on a number line, the sample mean would be in the center. Hence the sum of squares with respect to the sample mean would be the smallest possible sum, and this is possible to prove theoretically! If the true mean of our number generator is not 5, our sum of squares would be larger. We will be underestimating the variance if we divide the sum of squares by 10. We need to divide by a lesser vaule to compensate, and that value is actually one less the sample size. In our example, we need to divide by 9.</p>
        <p class = "blogText">Sadly, I am not going to delve into why we divide by n-1 instead of say, n-2. Good resources such as Khan Academy explain it well from a theoretical point of view. An intuitve reasoning of this based on degrees of freedom, which I have found lacking in literature, is in the video below. Kudos for making it this far, and I hope you now have a rough idea on how to answer the title of this post.</p>
