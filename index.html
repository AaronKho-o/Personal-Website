        <div class = "row blogBody" id = "blogBody1">
          <p class = "blogText">It is well known that the formula to calculate variance of a sample dataset is the sum of squares divided by the sample size less one. I remember being asked by a friend: "Why minus one?" To my great shame as a statistics major, I could give neither a rigorous nor intuitive answer. This post serves to regain some lost pride and is aimed at those with a basic understanding of descriptive statistics.</p>
          <p class = "blogText">We shall take an empirical approach, which is a fancy way of saying we work with observations rather than pure theory. Suppose we have a random generator of numbers from 1 to 10. We use it to generate 10 numbers and obtain the set (7 8 1 5 6 9 10 1 2 1).</p>
          <p class = "blogText">Our goal is to describe this dataset with a single number. Let us take the average to obtain the sample mean = 5. <span class = "fw-bolder">The sample mean is called a statistic and is a measure of central tendency.</span> In simple terms, it tells us where the center of the data is. Median and Mode are other statistics that measure central tendency.</p>
          <p class = "blogText">Now suppose we want to measure dispersion, or how spread out the data is from the center. The sum of squared deviations from the sample mean is a good indicator of this and illustrated below.</p>
          <img src = "images/blogs/blog1/sumOfSquares.jpg" class = "blogImg">
          <p>The next logical step would be to average it out by dividing by 10. However, think about this for a moment. We would be introducing bias to our statistic! </p>
          <img src = "images/blogs/blog1/dataOnNumLine.jpg" class = "blogImg">
          <p class = "blogText">If our data was represented on a number line, the sample mean would be in the center. Hence the sum of squares with respect to the sample mean would be the smallest possible sum, and this is possible to prove theoretically! If the true mean of our number generator is not 5, our sum of squares would be larger. <span class = "fw-bolder">We will be underestimating the variance if we divide the sum of squares by 10.</span> We need to divide by a lesser value to compensate, and that value turns out to be one less the sample size. In our example, we need to divide by 9.</p>
          <p class = "blogText">Sadly, I am not going to delve into why we divide by n-1 instead of say, n-2. Good resources such as <a href = "https://www.khanacademy.org/math/ap-statistics/summarizing-quantitative-data-ap/more-standard-deviation/v/review-and-intuition-why-we-divide-by-n-1-for-the-unbiased-sample-variance" target="_blank">Khan Academy</a> explain it well from a theoretical point of view. An intuitive reasoning of this based on degrees of freedom, which I have found lacking in literature, is in the video below. Kudos for making it this far, and I hope you now have a rough idea on how to answer the title of this post.</p>

        <!-- <div class = "blogTitleMain" id = "blogTitle2" tabindex='0'>Covariance Matrix of High Dimensional Data</div>
        <div class = "row blogBody" id = "blogBody2">
          <p class = "blogText">As we trod down the path of statisticians, our datasets increase in both size and complexity. It is well enough analysing 10,000 rows of data, but what if we need to analyse billions of rows with 100,000 variables? This might seem implausible, but certainly not impossible given the <a href = "https://www.researchgate.net/figure/The-exponential-data-growth-estimated-between-2010-and-2020-1_fig1_329298440" target = "_blank">exponential growth of data</a> in the past decade. Dimensional reduction techniques such as Principal Component Analysis (PCA) are more important than ever. This blog aims to discuss the dimensions of covariance matrices corresponding to complex datasets as they play an important role in deriving the aforementioned algorithm and are often confusing in literature.</p>
          <p class = "blogText">Consider a dataset with 3 observations and each of them 2-dimensional. This would be akin to 3 days spent recording the amount of rainfall and hours of sunshine. We represent the data in matrix form with column vectors corresponding to parameters (rainfall & sunshine), and row vectors corresponding to each observation (days). Suppose we know that the true mean (ie. population mean) of each variable is zero.</p>
          <img src = "images/blogs/blog2/varianceOf3x2.jpg" class = "blogImg">
          <p class = "blogText">As a quick intepretation, the diagonal elements of the covariance matrix correspond to the variance of each column vector which are 1-dimensional datasets. The non-diagonal elements represent the covariance between the two column vectors and are equal. The calculation is quite standard and most texts find the convariance matrix by applying matrix multiplication on the transpose of X with X in that order. However, the only reason it is not the other way round is due to our choice of represention of the data! If the column vectors had corresponded to the observations and row vectors to parameters, the variance of the data matrix would instead be X multiplied by X transposed.</p>
          <p class = "blogText">This might not seem like a big deal, but statisticians tend to represent single observations as column vectors. Suppose we have one observation with p parameters. On its own, this would be written as a column vector but if there were n observations, it would be a row vector in the matrix of all observations.</p>
          <p class = "blogText">The image below shows this in the context of our example.</p>
          <img src = "images/blogs/blog2/varianceOf2x1.jpg" class = "blogImg">
          <p class = "blogText">This has been the cause of much confusion during my undergraduate years. My advice is to remember that the dimensions of a covariance matrix is always the number of parameters in its dataset, not the number of observations. We are trying to measure the covariance between variables, not between observations. It seems trivial but when reading statistical theory, can cause a headache since it is all very abstract.</p>

        <!-- <div class = "blogTitleMain" id = "blogTitle3" tabindex='0'>Effective Sample Size, Variance and Belief</div>
        <div class = "row blogBody" id = "blogBody3">
          <p class = "blogText">A quick search of effective sample size exposes many resources which either define it mathematically or in a verbose manner. We state both approaches here and start with an independent and identically distributed (iid) sample where the true mean and variance are known. The effective sample size n* is defined as follows.</p>
          <img src = "images/blogs/blog3/effectiveSampleSizeDef.jpg" class = "blogImg">
          <p class = "blogText">Now that is all well and good, but why did statisticians bother defining n* instead of leaving the coefficient of sigma squared as is? Turns out, <span class = "fw-bolder">n* represents the size of an iid sample that contains the same amount of precision as our dataset!</span> Notice here, and in many other web resources, the use of "precision" instead of "information". To explain why the word precision is used, we need to dive into the nuances of variance and discover what it really represents.</p>
          <p class = "blogText">Suppose you are asked how likely it will rain tomorrow. If you live in the UK, perhaps your answer would be 80% as you think it will rain more likely than not, but how would we explain this thought process mathematically? Human guesses can be modelled with the Beta distribution due to three characteristics. First, it is defined on the interval [0, 1] which represents the range of probability. Second, it can be skewed right or left depending on whether an event is likely or unlikely. Third, the variance can be increased or reduced depending on the strength of belief. To illustrate how variance ties with belief, consider the following example of Sarah and John. Sarah thinks the probability it will rain follows a Beta distribution with mean 0.5 and variance 0.5. John also assumes a Beta distribution but with mean 0.8 and variance 0.1. Anyone with an idea of variance can tell you that John is more <span class = "fw-bolder">precise</span> (confident) about his guess than Sarah. The two distributions are illustrated to make this even clearer.</p>
          <img src = "images/blogs/blog3/betaDistribution.jpg" class = "blogImg">
          <p class = "blogText">Thus, we can conclude that the word precise is used because n* represents the size of an iid sample that has the same variance as our dataset. That covers the basics of this intriguing topic, but I encourage you to think about correlation structures and their effect on the value of n*. For example, when correlation is constant and negative, the effective sample size may be larger than the original sample size! It is amazing that this is possible as intuitively, one might assume any correlation among our observations will lead to lower precision since the existence of correlation implies a linear pattern. However, this is not the case and most of the time correlation is not even constant!</p>

        <div class = "blogTitleMain" id = "blogTitle1" tabindex='0'>A trip and a half up Snowdon</div>
        <div class = "row blogBody" id = "blogBody1">
          <p class = "blogText">Hiking up a mountain with a 60-year-old man should be easy - Those were my thoughts as I agreed to scale Scafell Pike with my housemate Patrick back in the late summer of 2021. It turned out that 60-year-old man had been hiking mountains around the world his entire life, and I managed about an eighth of the way before having to admit I could not keep with the pace. It was a humbling experience as someone who had been a competitive swimmer and always considered fit. I resolved to exercise and train hard to get my fitness up and hike with Patrick again.</p>
          <p class = "blogText">The opportunity came 8 months later when we decided to hike up Snowdon - the mountain with the highest peak in Wales and England at 1085 metres above sea level. While a good height, Everest peaks at 8849 metres which puts into context the relative diminutive size of British mountains. Nevertheless, the route we took was a 6 hour climb and we aimed to finish it in half the time which was quite a challenge.</p>
          <img src = "images/blogs/blog1/pic1.jpg" class = "blogImg">
          <p class = "blogText">We started at the foot of Snowdon in Llanberis, and it was a full-on speed walk up steep slopes from the start. The beginning was the hardest bit as our bodies acclimatised to the effort after sitting 3 hours in a car, but we soon got into our stride and kept the pace we had set. We had some food an hour earlier which really helped in keeping our energy levels up. The scenery was beautiful but could have been more so since the sun was hidden by the clouds. There was a train taking people up to the peak, and we noticed many other potential trails along the way, an adventure for next time!</p>
          <p class = "blogText">Against all odds, we managed to get to the top in an hour and a half, passing more than 100 people on our way! We could only stop once due to time constraints, and it felt more like a workout than anything. We ate lunch at the peak and admired as much as we could see of the view given the clouds. Then we set off and completed the 2nd part of the journey at the same time as the 1st. Overall, we took 3 and a half hours to complete Snowdon - that half being spent at the peak; hence we considered our goal achieved.</p>
          <img src = "images/blogs/blog1/pic2.jpg" class = "blogImg">
          <p class = "blogText">This was an experience that encompassed many months. Between the 2 hikes involved many hours in the gym, playing football, and joining 5k parkruns every Saturday. It reinforced the idea that commitment to achieving an objective is really important, being prepared on the day is key, and having an experienced mentor makes a lot of difference. These are true in sport, the workplace, and life too.</p>
          <p class = "blogText">The next mountain I hiked was also in Wales, but that’s a whole other story!</p>

        <div class = "blogTitleMain" id = "blogTitle2" tabindex='1'>Proclaim the gospel boldy</div>
        <div class = "row blogBody" id = "blogBody2">
          <p class = "blogText">Dietrich Bonhoeffer was one of the most well-known Christians of the 20th century. His book titled “The Cost of Discipleship” is a classic and I could barely wait to dive into the rich contents of its pages. It proved an incredible and challenging read, but I was naïve in thinking I would agree with all the author’s opinions. For in the context of spreading the gospel, he writes that it is fine for Christians to run away if their weakness is the weakness of the Word. How timid! Yet after pondering this for 2 months, I have concluded that there is some truth to what Bonhoeffer meant, though he could have explained it a little better.</p>
          <p class = "blogText">Firstly, Bonhoeffer says the Word is weak when compared to an ideal, which is something people can strive towards since the best ones are usually not yet realised. For example, ideally people everywhere should be happy all the time. We can take steps toward achieving this goal by improving income inequality, standard of living, and teaching good moral behaviour. However, the Word of God is much more than an ideal – it is to non-believers a description of reality, and to Christians it is reality. You can either accept or reject it, but never work to achieve it. This means when we witness for Christ to others, we can only tell them about him. In this sense, the Word is weaker than any ideology. Bonhoeffer is also correct when he says we do not have the right or power to impose the gospel by force if he means attempting to force others to believe in Christ. None of us can create faith in another; this is the regenerating work of the Holy Spirit. However, if he means we cannot proclaim the gospel when people have already expressed their rejection of it, this begs more careful consideration which will be given shortly.</p>
          <p class = "blogText">Secondly, we must note that while the Word having an element of weakness may have been part of Bonhoeffer’s theology born out of his interpretation of the entirety of scripture, he derives it here from Matthew 7:6. Specifically: “Do not give dogs what is holy, and do not throw your pearls before pigs, lest they trample them underfoot and turn to attack you.” The German understands this to mean we should not preach certain aspects of the gospel to some non-believers since they do not recognise the greatness of the message and will profane the forgiveness of God. In terms of who classifies as these non-believers, the author is unspecific and instructs Christians to flee when the Word chooses to be weak and pray to God for the non-believer. While this can be justified biblically to a certain extent, Bonhoeffer starts his take on this discussion by implying it is a natural extension of being forbidden to judge others as per Matthew 7:1. However, he completely ignores Matthew 7:5 which says: “…first take the log out of your own eye, and then you will see clearly to take the speck out of your brother’s eye.” We shall deal with the matter of judgement first before tackling the issue of proclaiming the word of salvation to people who have already rejected it.</p>
          <p class = "blogText">In Leviticus 10:10, the priests are clearly called to “distinguish between the holy and the common, and between the unclean and the clean.” They are to exercise judgement upon people based on the law spoken by God. Furthermore, the Lord says in Leviticus 20:4-5 and 24:16 that the whole congregation of Israel must stone a man when he commits specific sinful actions related to idolatry and blasphemy. Every single person of God’s covenant people had to judge the man guilty and carry out due punishment upon him. That is all well and good, but we must also consider how we are to live as disciples under the new covenant. In Jeremiah 31:34, God says that all those saved under the new covenant through Christ will know the Lord. This means those under the new covenant know what is pleasing to the Lord and what is not, and we are also called to follow Jesus which implies we must know his will in our lives. For if not how are we to follow him? Turning to Matthew 7:5 which Bonhoeffer ignored, Jesus does not condemn taking the speck out of our brother’s eye but warns of hypocrisy in doing so. Even looking at Matthew 7:6 which underlies this essay, if we are not to give dogs and pigs what is holy, we must exercise judgement. For how else can we recognise dogs and pigs? Thus, I believe there is biblical evidence that Christians are called to judge in certain situations such as excommunication, but to do so carefully with the warning that we will be judged with the judgement we pronounce.</p>
          <p class = "blogText">With regards to spreading the gospel to people who have rejected it, we observe that Jesus only left when people begged him to leave (Matthew 8:34), when the Pharisees conspired against him (Matthew 12:15), and when people were trying to stone him (John 8:59, 10:39). In all cases except the first it was because the religious leaders were going to kill him, but Jesus knew his time was not yet and hence he did not let them. For he says in John 10:18: “No one takes it [his life] from me, but I lay it down of my own accord.” Even when he spoke to Jews about to stone him for blasphemy, he always claimed to be the Son of God and always spoke the truth. He hid himself from them and used scripture to confuse them, all while claiming he was and is the Son of God. Even when people did not believe him in his hometown, Jesus did not leave immediately but only limited the mighty works he did (Matthew 13:58). He continued proclaiming the truth till the rulers crucified him, as that was the manner of death he had chosen.</p>
          <p class = "blogText">The apostle Paul also fled when rulers were trying to kill him, though he was imprisoned many times and unsure if he would die. Paul and Barnabas also fled from Iconium upon hearing of the attempt by both Gentiles and Jews, with their rulers, to mistreat them and stone them. However, he never stopped proclaiming the Word and during his time in custody stood and preached before the emperor of Rome. He was willing to suffer and die for his faith.</p>
          <p class = "blogText">I conclude we should continue proclaiming the gospel till people beg us to leave, or they reject the gospel strongly and there are others who have not heard the good news in our lives, or people want to kill us for it. In all things pray to God for guidance and for their salvation. When it is not possible to escape suffering, imprisonment, and death if we speak the truth, then may the Lord bless us with strength to endure. Note that we did not investigate many things including whether Bonhoeffer meant specifically that the gospel of forgiveness should not be preached to those who do not repent. Also, many terms I used throughout this piece have not been rigorously defined, so take this with a pinch of salt and read the bible yourself.</p>
          <p class = "blogText">Ultimately, we want to be able to say as Paul did in Acts 20:26-27: “Therefore I testify to you this day that I am innocent of the blood of all, for I did not shrink from declaring to you the whole counsel of God.”</p>
